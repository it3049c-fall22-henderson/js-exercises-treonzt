## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 68 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I think that I deserve a 20/20, I followed the instructions exactly. I'm a little confused on if I was supposed to complete files 2,4,5,6,and 7. In the first page of the instructions it said we would be using these files but the instructions never specified what to do with them, were we supposed to complete only the two examples?

## Self-Reflection:
The npm test is really interesting, and very helpful to find out the specific problem with my code

### How long it took you to finish this?
